I’m sure you’ll agree that, at this point, it isn’t an exaggeration
to say that we are at war against the coronavirus and that it is a
war we must win. The next few weeks are critical in this battle. I
request everyone to stay at home and enjoy good time with
family.

### Stay Home, Stay Safe

:wave: [DO THE FIVE](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/): Help stop coronavirus

1. **HANDS**: Wash them often
2. **ELBOW**: Cough into it
3. **FACE**: Don't touch it
4. **SPACE**: Keep safe distance
